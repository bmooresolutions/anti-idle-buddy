# Anti-Idle PowerShell Script

## TL;DR  
**Run this to keep your game from idling out while you stuff your face.**

---

## What It Does

This PowerShell script simulates activity on your computer to prevent idle timeouts in video games or other applications. Specifically, it:

- Jiggles your mouse slightly every 32 seconds.
- Holds down the **W** key for 4 seconds every cycle (to simulate movement).

This tricks your game into thinking you're still active, keeping you connected and in motion.

## How It Works

The script uses Windows APIs to:

- Move the mouse cursor by 1 pixel and back.
- Send virtual keypress events for the **W** key.
- Repeat these actions in a loop every 32 seconds.

Itâ€™s lightweight, easy to run, and doesnâ€™t require any external software.
