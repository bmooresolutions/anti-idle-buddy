Anti-Idle PowerShell Script
TL;DR
Run this to keep your game from idling out while you stuff your face.

What It Does
This PowerShell script simulates activity on your computer to prevent idle timeouts in video games or other applications. Specifically, it:

Jiggles your mouse slightly every 32 seconds.

Holds down the W key for 4 seconds every cycle (to simulate movement).

This tricks your game into thinking you're still active, keeping you connected and in motion.

 How It Works
The script uses Windows APIs to:

Move the mouse cursor by 1 pixel and back.

Send virtual keypress events for the W key.

Repeat these actions in a loop every 32 seconds.

It’s lightweight, easy to run, and doesn’t require any external software.

 How to Use
Open Notepad and paste the script contents.

Save the file as anti-idle.ps1.

Right-click the file and choose Run with PowerShell.

Leave it running in the background while you game, snack, or take a break.

💡 You may need to run PowerShell as Administrator depending on your system settings.

⚠️ Disclaimer
Use responsibly. Some games may consider this a form of automation and could penalize you. Always check the game's terms of service before using scripts like this.
